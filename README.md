# Human Comfort Responses in Winter Environments

This project documents my personal exploration of **how humans respond to cold winter environments** and what factors contribute to comfort. The idea has fascinated me since childhood: how people seek warmth, the cozy sensation of blankets, warm drinks in hand, and hot showers. This curiosity led me to observe, read, and write an essay exploring both the **cognitive and physical effects of cold exposure**.

## 🔍 Motivation & Process

- **Personal Interest:**  
  I have always been intrigued by the subtle ways humans seek comfort during winter. There is something beautiful in the season—the feeling of being wrapped in a blanket, sipping a warm drink, or enjoying a hot shower. I wanted to understand **what makes these experiences physically and mentally beneficial**.

- **Active Observation:**  
  I focused on three key factors that often provide comfort:  
  1. Warm drinks  
  2. Heavy blankets  
  3. Warm showers  

- **Research Process:**  
  1. Defined the topic and key factors contributing to human comfort.  
  2. Explored the **cognitive and physiological effects of cold exposure**.  
  3. Read and synthesized the following scientific literature:
